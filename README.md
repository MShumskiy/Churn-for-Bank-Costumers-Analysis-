## Abstract  
In this project I analyze customer retention, determine the most relevant parameters that retain customers, implement several Machine Learning Classification Algorithms and compare to determine which better performs the classification.  
This project has application across a vast number of enterprises which concern themselves with client retention.  
It is worthy of note that this project is also of help to better plan and employ marketing campaigns to attract new customers.  
With this in mind, the work developed here is of great value.  
The analysis as well as the code is presented in this work.

## 1. Introduction  
Client retention is a subject of great importance to many enterprises, for it increases a company's performance in the market which, in turn, reflects in higher revenue and overall growth of said company.  
To extract insights related to the topic here discussed, data from existing customers and former costumers must be analyzed, with the proper tools, to determine the most relevant parameters in their decision to leave or to stay.  
Since every enterprise of success must look towards the future, Machine Learning Algorithms must be implemented to give prediction power, on which the company rely.
 
## 2. Methodology 
The method of analysis consists of the following phases:  
 1. Data Cleaning,  
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis,  
 3. Machine Learning Classification Algorithms implementation and performance comparison,  
 4. Implementation of the most accurate Classification Algorithm.  

### 2.1. The Data  
Was analyzed data from Kaggle named Churn for Bank Customers by Mehmet A.  
## 4. Conclusion  
This project was developed with the intent to determine the most relevant parameters in client exits, as well as implementation of the Machine Learning model with best performance.  
The parameters with most relevance for the client decision to either leave or stay are ordered as follow:  
 1. Age, the younger people tend to stay and displayed interesting distributions worth examining in the future,  
 2. Level of Activity, the more active members tend to stay,  
 3. Account Balance, clients with lower balance tend to stay,  
 4. Gender, the men tend to stay more than women.  
 
As for the Machine Learning model, the **Random Forest Classifier** performed the best, therefore, it shall be the model to be implemented.  
It is worth to note of the uses of this project. With this information the bank can determine it's focus points to retain clients, as well as to direct its marketing campaigns to acquire new ones. This work can be, easily, applied to other enterprises.
